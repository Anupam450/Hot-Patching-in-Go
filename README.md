# ðŸ”¥ Hot Patching in Go â€“ Demo Repo

This repo demonstrates two approaches:

## Stage 1 â€“ Downtime

- V1 running, must stop process to apply V2.
- Shows visible downtime.

## Stage 2 â€“ Hot Patch

- V1 starts (with bug).
- After bug detection, we compile `plugin/v2/v2.go` into `v2.so`.
- Patch applied dynamically at runtime â†’ **zero downtime**.
